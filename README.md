### Steps I Followed to Complete the Assignment:

1. I created a simple blog using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
2. I read the article provided with the assignment and watched a few videos to clarify some points.  
3. I created a `manifest.json` file to define the background, name, and display mode of the application (how it behaves when installed on a device).  
4. From the `script.js` file, I scoped the `sw.js` file.  
5. I created a `sw.js` file to specify which files to cache in temporary storage, enabling the web app to work offline, load faster, and perform background tasks.  

### Challenges I Faced:

After uploading my assignment solution to GitHub, when I tried to run the app or use it offline, I got a 404 error or a "No Internet Connection" message.  

### How I Solved the Issue:

I tested the app again on localhost in VS Code, and it worked fine. I then realized that when uploading the project to GitHub, I needed to adjust the file paths to include the repository name first, followed by the file name.
