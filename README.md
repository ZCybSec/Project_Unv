### 🌟 Steps I Followed to Complete the Assignment:  

1. 🖥️ I created a simple blog using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
2. 📖 I read the article provided with the assignment and watched a few videos to clarify some points.  
3. 📝 I created a `manifest.json` file to define the **background, name, and display mode** of the application (how it behaves when installed on a device).  
4. 📜 From the `script.js` file, I scoped the `sw.js` file.  
5. 💾 I created a `sw.js` file to specify which files to **cache in temporary storage**, enabling the web app to:  
   - Work offline 📴  
   - Load faster ⚡  
   - Perform background tasks 🔄  

### ⚠️ Challenges I Faced:  

- After uploading my assignment solution to GitHub, when I tried to run the app or use it offline, I got a **404 error** or a "No Internet Connection" message.  

### ✅ How I Solved the Issue:  

- 🔍 I tested the app again on **localhost in VS Code**, and it worked fine.  
- 🛠️ I then realized that when uploading the project to **GitHub**, I needed to adjust the **file paths** to include the repository name first, followed by the file name.
